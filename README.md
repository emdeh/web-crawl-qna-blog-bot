# Q&A blog bot with embeddings

# Introduction
//TO-DO

### Credits

Based off **OpenAI's Web  Q&A with Embeddings tutorial**. Learn how to crawl your website and build a Q/A bot with the OpenAI API. You can find the full tutorial in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings).

## Structure
//TO-DO

## Getting started...

### Clone or fork this repository

First you need to create your own version.

### Work from a virtual environment

To start, create a `venv` with `python3 -m venv venv` in the root directory.

Then run `source venv/bin/activate`; again from the `/root` directory.

This will install `requirements.txt` for you, which are primarily based on the [Q&A with embeddings tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings).

You can also use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to periodically update the `/requirements.txt` file if you're developing.

### You need to create an `.env` file for the API key

Create a `.env` file in the `/chatbot-backend` directory.

This file should store your OpenAI API key. It should look like this:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=key-here-with-not-quotes
```

## Python depdendencies

There is another `/requiremnets.txt` in the `/chatbot-backend/` directory, which I will probably consolidate eventually.
