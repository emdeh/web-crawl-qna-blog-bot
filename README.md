# Q&A blog bot with embeddings

# Introduction

## Structure

## Prerequisites

Work from a `venv`.

To start, create a `venv` with `python3 -m venv venv`.

Then run `source venv/bin/activate` from the `/root` directory.

This will install `requirements.txt` for you, which are primarily based on the Q&A with embeddings tutorial.

You can also use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to periodically update the `/requirements.txt` file.

## Python depdendencies

There is another `/requiremnets.txt` in the `/chatbot-backed/` directory.

## Based off OpenAI's Web  Q&A with Embeddings tutorial

Learn how to crawl your website and build a Q/A bot with the OpenAI API. You can find the full tutorial in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings).
