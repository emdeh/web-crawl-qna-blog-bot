# Flask app initialisation

This line initializes a new Flask application instance. Flask is a Python web framework that allows for the development of web applications.

```python
# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='static')
```

- ` __name__` is a special variable in Python that is used here to determine the root path of the Flask application. This enables Flask to know where to look for resources like templates and static files.
- `static_folder='static'` specifies the directory within the application that Flask will use to serve static files (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, images). By default, Flask serves static files from a folder named `static` in the root path of the application. This parameter explicitly sets the folder name, enhancing readability and maintainability.
