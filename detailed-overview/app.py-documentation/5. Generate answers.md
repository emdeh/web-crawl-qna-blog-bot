# Generate answers

The `answer_question` function is designed to generate an answer to a given question by utilizing the context created from texts within a DataFrame and leveraging OpenAI's GPT model.

```python
def answer_question(
    df,
    question,
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    max_len=1800,
    size="ada",
    debug=False,
    max_tokens=150,
    stop_sequence=None
):
    """
    Answer a question based on the most similar context from the dataframe texts
    """
    context = create_context(
        question,
        df,
        max_len=max_len,
        size=size,
    )
    # If debug, print the raw model response
    if debug:
        print("Context:\n" + context)
        print("\n\n")
        print("\n\nQuestion:\n" + question)

    try:
        # Create a chat completion using the question and context
        
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": f"Answer this question based on the context below: {question}. If the question can't be answered based on the context, say \"SALSA\"\n\n"},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Context: {context}\n\n---\n\nAnswer:"},
            ],
            temperature=0,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            top_p=1,
            frequency_penalty=0,
            presence_penalty=0,
            stop=stop_sequence)
        
        # Print the entire response object for inspection
        if debug:
            print("\n\nFull Response Object:\n")
            print(response)  # This line prints the entire response object

        # Extracting and returning the completion text
        completion_text = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
        return completion_text
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        return ""
```

Here's a detailed explanation of its workflow and components:

**Parameters**
- `df`: The DataFrame containing texts and their embeddings, used to find the most relevant context for the question.
- `question`: The question to be answered.
- `model`: Specifies the GPT model to use for generating answers, defaulting to "gpt-3.5-turbo".
- `max_len`: The maximum length of the context in tokens. This helps ensure the context passed to the model does not exceed the model's maximum input size.
- `size`: The size of the model used for embeddings, defaulted to "ada".
- `debug`: A boolean flag used to print additional information for debugging purposes.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens allowed in the model's response.
- `stop_sequence`: Optional parameter defining sequences where the model should stop generating further tokens.

**Functionality Breakdown**

1. Context Creation:
- The function begins by calling `create_context`, which generates a context for the question from the DataFrame `df`. This context is assembled based on similarity to the question's embeddings, ensuring relevance.

2. Debugging Information:
- If `debug` is `True`, the function prints the generated context and the question to the console. This feature is useful for developers to inspect the context being used and to ensure it aligns well with the question.

3. Generating an Answer:
- The function then uses OpenAI's `client.chat.completions.create` to generate an answer. This method sends a request to the specified GPT model, providing it with the context and the question structured in a way that guides the model to generate an appropriate answer based on the provided context.
- The `model` parameter specifies which GPT model version to use.
- The `messages` parameter includes both the system prompt, which instructs the model on how to use the context to answer the question, and the user prompt, which combines the context with the question itself.
- The `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, and `presence_penalty` parameters control the creativity, length, and focus of the model's response.

**4. Handling the Response:**
- The model's response is captured in the `response` variable. If `debug` is `True`, the entire response object is printed, allowing for a detailed inspection of the model's output and metadata.
- The function extracts the completion text from `response.choices[0].message.content` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This extracted text is the model-generated answer to the question.

**5. Error Handling:**
- A `try-except` block is used to catch and print any exceptions that occur during the API call or processing, ensuring the function does not crash the application on errors. In case of an exception, the function returns an empty string as a fallback.

**Return Value**
The function returns the generated answer as a string. This answer is based on the most similar context found within the DataFrame and is tailored to the specific question asked, leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT model to provide informative and contextually relevant responses.

This `answer_question` function encapsulates the entire process of context-based question answering, from context generation to leveraging advanced AI models for generating responses, making it a crucial component for applications requiring dynamic and intelligent text-based interactions.
