# Seting up OpenAI API client

```python
load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```

- `load_dotenv()` loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the environment. This is particularly useful for managing sensitive data like API keys, as it keeps them out of the source code.
- `client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))` initialises an OpenAI client with the API key retrieved from the environment variables. This client is used to interact with OpenAI's API, allowing the application to perform operations like generating text completions or embeddings. The `os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")` function retrieves the value of the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which should be the API key for OpenAI.
