# Flask routes

These code snippets define two Flask routes for a web application. Flask uses decorators to link functions to web page routes, allowing for the creation of dynamic web applications with Python. 

Together, these routes enable a web application where users can submit questions via a form (or any other frontend that makes POST requests to `/ask`) and receive answers dynamically generated by the backend. The home route provides a simple way to serve the main HTML page of the application, potentially containing the form or interface for users to interact with the question-answering functionality.

Here's a breakdown of each route:

**The `/ask` Route**

```python
@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    content = request.json
    question = content.get('question')

    answer = answer_question(df, question=question, debug=False)  # Assuming debug=True for development
    return jsonify({'answer': answer})
```
**- Route Definition:** `@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])` declares a new route `/ask` that accepts `POST` requests. This is typically used for submitting data to the server in a more secure manner than `GET` requests.

**- Function ask:** When a POST request is made to `/ask`, the ask function is executed. This function is designed to handle questions submitted as JSON payloads.

**- Extract Question:** The function extracts the `question` from the JSON payload of the request. `request.json` is a Flask feature that automatically parses JSON request data, and `content.get('question')` safely retrieves the `question` value from this dictionary.

**- Generate Answer:** It then calls the `answer_question` function, passing the DataFrame `df` and the extracted `question`. The `answer_question` function generates an answer based on the context created from `df`.

**- Return Response:** The generated answer is returned to the client as a JSON response using `jsonify({'answer': answer})`. `jsonify` is a Flask utility that converts the dictionary into a JSON formatted response, setting the appropriate Content-Type header.

**The `/ (Home)` Route**

```python
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return app.send_static_file('index.html')
```
**- Route Definition:** `@app.route('/')` defines the root route of the web application, which is the default page users see when they visit the base URL.

**- Function home:** The `home` function is called when a request is made to the root route. It serves the purpose of displaying the home page of the web application.

**- Serve Static File:** The function uses `app.send_static_file('index.html')` to directly serve the index.html file from the static folder. This method is a convenient way to serve static files without requiring a separate web server or additional configuration.
