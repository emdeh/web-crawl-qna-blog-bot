# Overview
There are two main scripts: `preprocess.py` and `app.py`. 
- `preprocess.py` crawls a specified domain to collect text data, preprocess and generate embeddings for the collected data
- `app.py` provides answers to questions based on the generated embeddings using OpenAI's GPT model. The question and answers are received and served via a simple Flask application.

## preprocess.py

### Main Functionalities
- **Crawling**: The script starts by defining a domain to crawl and collects hyperlinks within that domain to gather text data.
- **HTML Parsing**: A custom HTMLParser class, HyperlinkParser, is defined to extract `href` attributes from `<a>` tags.
- **Text Extraction and Cleaning**: Text is extracted from crawled pages and cleaned to remove unnecessary whitespace and newline characters.
- **Embedding Generation**: Using OpenAI's API, embeddings for the cleaned text are generated and stored.

### Functions
- `get_hyperlinks(url)`: Extracts hyperlinks from the specified URL.
- `get_domain_hyperlinks(local_domain, url)`: Filters hyperlinks to include only those within the specified domain.
- `crawl(url)`: Orchestrates the crawling process, collecting text data and saving it.
- `remove_newlines(serie)`: Cleans text data by removing newline characters.
- `generate_embeddings(df)`: Generates embeddings for the text data and saves the results.

## app.py

### Flask Application
- Initialises a Flask app and loads a DataFrame of embeddings generated by `preprocess.py`.
- Defines routes for answering questions and serving static files.

### Main Functionalities
- **Context Creation**: Given a question, the script creates a context by finding the most similar texts based on embeddings.
- **Answer Generation**: Utilises OpenAI's GPT model to generate answers based on the context created for the given question.

### Functions
- `create_context(question, df, max_len, size)`: Creates context for a question from the DataFrame based on embeddings similarity.
- `answer_question(df, question, model, max_len, size, debug, max_tokens, stop_sequence)`: Generates an answer to the given question using the context created by create_context.

**Flask Routes:**
- `ask()`: Accepts POST requests with a question and returns the generated answer.
- `home()`: Serves the static homepage.

# Running the Application
Ensure all dependencies are installed and environment variables are set.
Run `preprocess.py` to crawl the domain and generate embeddings.
Start the Flask application by running `app.py`.
