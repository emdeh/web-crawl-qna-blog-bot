# Read text files

The script iterates through all text files in `text/<domain>` and reads the content of each file. It performs preliminary cleaning on the file names and associates them with their content.
```python

# Create a list to store the text files
texts=[]

# Get all the text files in the text directory
for file in os.listdir("text/" + domain + "/"):

    # Open the file and read the text
    with open("text/" + domain + "/" + file, "r", encoding="UTF-8") as f:
        text = f.read()

        # Omit the first 11 lines and the last 4 lines, then replace -, _, and #update with spaces.
        texts.append((file[11:-4].replace('-',' ').replace('_', ' ').replace('#update',''), text))
```
