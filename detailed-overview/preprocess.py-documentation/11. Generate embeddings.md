# Generate embeddings

The `generate_embeddings(df)` function is designed to generate embeddings for each piece of text contained within a DataFrame `df` using OpenAI's API, specifically leveraging the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. This function enriches the DataFrame by adding a new column (`embeddings`) that holds the numerical vector representation (embedding) of the text, which is crucial for many natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tasks. 

```python
def generate_embeddings(df):
    # Assuming tiktoken and the use of OpenAI's API are setup correctly
    df['embeddings'] = df['text'].apply(lambda x: client.embeddings.create(input=x, engine='text-embedding-ada-002')['data'][0]['embedding'])
    df.to_csv('data/embeddings.csv')
    df.head()
    print("Embeddings generated and saved to 'data/embeddings.csv'.")
```

Here's how the function operatings

**Process Overview**
**1. Applying the Embeddings Creation:** The function iterates over each row's `text` column in the DataFrame `df` by using the `.apply()` method. For each piece of text (`x`), it calls `client.embeddings.create(input=x, engine='text-embedding-ada-002')`, which sends a request to OpenAI's API to generate an embedding for the text. The `engine` parameter specifies the model used for generating embeddings, in this case, `text-embedding-ada-002`, which is tailored for creating text embeddings.

**2. Extracting the Embedding:** After the API call, the function extracts the actual embedding from the API's response. OpenAI's API response for embeddings includes a data field containing a list of result objects, where each object holds an `embedding` among other metadata. The function navigates through this structure (`['data'][0]['embedding']`) to access the first (and typically only) embedding in the response.

**3. Storing Embeddings:** The extracted embeddings are stored in a new column in the DataFrame, `df['embeddings']`. This operation effectively adds a high-dimensional vector representation for each text to the DataFrame, enabling advanced NLP tasks that rely on these numerical representations.

**4. Saving the Enhanced DataFrame:** Once all rows have been processed and their embeddings generated and stored, the function saves the updated DataFrame to a CSV file, `data/embeddings.csv`. This step persists the data with embeddings to disk, making it reusable for future analysis or modeling without needing to regenerate embeddings.

**5. Preview and Confirmation:** The function prints the first few rows of the updated DataFrame using `df.head()`, providing a quick preview of the embeddings. Additionally, it prints a confirmation message indicating that the embeddings have been generated and saved successfully.

**Use Cases and Significance**
Embeddings are foundational to many modern NLP applications. They provide a way to represent text as dense vectors that capture semantic meaning and relationships between words or texts. Applications include but are not limited to:

**- Semantic Similarity:** Determining how similar two pieces of text are by comparing their embeddings.
**- Text Classification:** Using embeddings as features for machine learning models to categorize texts.
**- Information Retrieval:** Enhancing search algorithms with embeddings to find relevant documents based on semantic similarity to a query.

By generating and storing embeddings for text data, `generate_embeddings(df)` prepares the dataset for these advanced NLP tasks, enabling deeper analysis and more intelligent applications based on the semantic content of the texts.
